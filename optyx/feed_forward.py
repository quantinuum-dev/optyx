# detectors
    # photon threshold detectors
    # photon number resolving detectors
# classically controlled gates
#  three classes taking any (suitable) gates as inputs and returning a new controlled gate:
    # classically controlled gates are gates that are controlled by classical bits
    # classically controlled gates with continuous parameters
    # classically controlled gates with discrete parameters
# classical functions on the outputs of detectors
#  input are the functions between natural numbers, bits and real numbers
    # to be used as an input to classically controlled gates
